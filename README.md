# Overview-Keywords

## Computation:

Computation is driven by the CPU (Central Processing Unit), GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These components form the backbone of data processing and number crunching in both personal and enterprise computing environments.

## Networking:

Local area network (LAN): A LAN covers a small geographic area suvh as a home, office or campus.

• Wide Area Network (WAN) :

A WAN spans a large geographic like multipke cities or countries.

• NIC (Network Interface Card):

A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component, typically a circuit board or chip, it allows computers to communicate with other devices on a network

• MAC:

It is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment

### OSI Model: 7 Layers of Networking
The OSI model is a framework that standardizes communication functions. It consists of 7 layers, divided into hardware layers and software layers:

• Physical Layer: Manages physical connections between devices, transmitting raw data.
• Data Link Layer: Ensures data transfer within the same network using MAC addresses.
• Network Layer: Routes data between networks using IP addresses.
• Transport Layer: The "heart" of OSI, ensures reliable data delivery with protocols like TCP and UDP.
• Session Layer: Manages communication sessions between devices.
• Presentation Layer: Translates data formats and handles encryption and compression.
• Application Layer: Interacts with the user through applications like web browsers and email.

## Operating Systems:

The OS (Operating System) manages hardware and software resources, creating a bridge between the two. Components include: 

**Kernel**: The core part of the OS that manages system resources.
OS Layer: Abstracts hardware resources for higher-level software.
**Applications**: Programs that run on top of the OS.
**CISC & RISC**: Two primary CPU instruction set architectures.
**Virtual Machine**: An emulation of a computer system.

## Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies:

Blockchain technology records and confirms cryptocurrency trades, like a digital ledger. It collects and stores information about buying, selling, or exchanging digital assets. This information exists without a central authority (such as a bank) overseeing or controlling the cryptocurrency market.

### Open Source:
Open source refers to software whose source code is made available to the public for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute. This model promotes collaboration and transparency.

###Closed Source: 
Proprietary software that doesn't allow users to view or modify its source code.

## Framework:
Layered structure indicating what kind of programs can or should be built

• Flutter: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
• Kivy: A Python framework for developing multitouch applications.
• Loki: A decentralized platform for private communication and transactions.

## Full stack development:
Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component

## Cloud Computing:
Cloud computing provides on-demand computing resources over the internet. It eliminates the need for maintaining physical hardware and offers flexible, scalable solutions.

## DevOps:
DevOps combines development and operations to automate and integrate software delivery and infrastructure changes. It relies on tools for continuous integration, monitoring, and deployment pipelines.
 is made available to the public for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute. This model promotes collaboration and transparency.
 
### More Keywords:
Tor: Anonymity network that routes internet traffic through a global.

Packets: Small units of data transmitted over a network, integral to the internet's functioning.

Firewalls: Protect networks from unauthorized access.

APIs: set of predefined rules and specifications for accessing a web-based software application or web toolined rules and specifications for accessing a web-based software application or web tool
